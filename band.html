	<dt>1. "She Got the Best of Me"</dt>
		<dd>This is the first song that I’ve heard by Luke Combs and I immediately loved it.
		 This breakup song that has been a #1 hit encourgaed me to listen to more of his 
		 songs and they do not disappoint!</dd>
	<dt>2. "Fast Car"</dt>
		<dd>This is a cover of Tracy Chapman’s “Fast Car.” Growing up I’ve enjoyed 
		listening to her version, so when Luke Combs came out with a cover it made me love
		 the song even more.</dd>
	<dt>3. "Houston, We Got a Problem"</dt>
		<dd>This song is about how Luke loves where he is, Houston, but it is missing one 
		person in particular. It is significant to me because I love Texas and I was able 
		to hear this song live in the Alamodome, which made it more special.</dd>
